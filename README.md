# web-defense
A repo to document findings from the 'Common Attacks on Web Applications' module from Codecademy's Backend Engineer career Path. 

In this repo you'll see the definition and how to prevent the following common attacks: 
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL Injection Attacks 

You can also see some defensive coding in JavaScript. 

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a vulnerability that tricks a user into submitting a web request on behalf of an attacker. This is often done by crafting a URL embedded with a request and tricking an authenticated user into clicking it. Examlpes include:
`http://bank.com/send?recipient=Stranger&amount=2000`
`https://oursite.com/changepassword.php?new_password=[USER PASSWORD]`
- CSRF attacks usually target state-changing web requests, such as payments, account information changes, fund transfers, and security setting changes. These attacks can be highly detrimental to the victim and can harm the reputation of the company behind the web application.
- One of the simplest ways to prevent CSRF attacks is to add a CSRF token to each request. This token is a unique, dynamically generated value used to verify all requests. The attacker does not have access to this token and cannot get the user to complete the same request without it.
- Despite the effectiveness of CSRF tokens, they can still fail if an application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. An attacker could use an XSS attack to extract the CSRF token.
- An additional layer of security against CSRF attacks is to ask users to re-authenticate by manually entering additional information prior to a critical request. This ensures that an attacker isnâ€™t able to easily compromise a user, even with XSS.

## SQL Injection 
SQL Injection is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious input. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, data manipulation, or even system takeover.

### Attack Methods
- Union-Based Injections: These use the SQL UNION keyword to combine results from two SELECT queries, potentially revealing sensitive information.
- Error-Based Injections: These force the application to return an error message that contains sensitive data.
- Boolean-Based Injections: These involve SQL statements that confirm TRUE/FALSE questions about the database, with the attacker observing changes in the web response.
- Time-Based Injections: These use SQL functions like SLEEP() and BENCHMARK() to cause delays in the application's response time, allowing the attacker to infer information.
- Out-of-Band SQL Injections: These are rare and difficult to execute, but involve the database server sending HTTP or DNS requests containing SQL query results to an attacker-controlled server.

### Prevention
- Input Sanitization: Always sanitize user inputs to ensure they do not contain SQL syntax. This can be done using functions that escape special characters or using allow-lists that only permit certain types of input.
- Prepared Statements: Use prepared statements (or parameterized queries) in your code. These ensure that user input is always treated as literal values and not part of the SQL command.

## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability where unsanitized input is rendered on the front end, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code (usually JavaScript) that can steal user data, redirect users to malicious pages, or take control of their browser.

### Attack methods
- Stored XSS: Occurs when a web server stores unsanitized user input and displays it to other users, allowing an attacker to inject and store a malicious script on the website.
- Reflected XSS: Occurs when a user's input is immediately returned back to them without being stored on the server, allowing attackers to target specific users with a malicious script.
- DOM-Based XSS: Occurs when user input is interpreted by the DOM, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that operates on the client-side.

### Prevention 
As with SQL Injection the main protection against XSS is Data Sanitization.
